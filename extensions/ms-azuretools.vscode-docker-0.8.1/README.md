## Docker for Visual Studio Code (Preview)

[![Version](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version/ms-azuretools.vscode-docker.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) [![Installs](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/installs-short/ms-azuretools.vscode-docker.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) [![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/ms-azuretools/AzCode/_apis/build/status/vscode-docker)](https://dev.azure.com/ms-azuretools/AzCode/_build/latest?definitionId=8)

The Docker extension makes it easy to build, manage and deploy containerized applications from Visual Studio Code. Check out the ["Working with Docker" tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/azure/docker) to get started.

**Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docker/wiki) for additional information about the extension.**

## Prerequisites

Install [Docker](https://aka.ms/AA37qtj) on your machine and add it to the system path.

On Linux, you must also follow the steps in “Manage Docker as a non-root user” from [Post-installation steps for Linux](https://aka.ms/AA37yk6) because VS Code runs as a non-root user.

## Features

* Automatic `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `.dockerignore` file generation (Press `F1` and search for `Docker: Add Docker files to Workspace`)
* Syntax highlighting, hover tips, IntelliSense (completions) for `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile` files
* Linting (errors and warnings) for `Dockerfile` files
* Command Palette (`F1`) integration for the most common Docker commands (for example `docker build`, `docker push`, etc.)
* Explorer integration for managing images, containers, registries, and more
* Deploy images from a registry directly to Azure App Service
* [Debug .NET Core applications](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/wiki/Debug-.NET-Core-(Preview)) running in Linux Docker containers

### Generating Docker Files

Press `F1` and search for `Docker: Add Docker Files to Workspace` to generate `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.debug.yml`, and `.dockerignore` files for your workspace type:

> Note: The `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.debug.yml` files are not generated for .NET Core applications.

### Editing

Rich IntelliSense (completions) for `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files:

### Docker Commands

Many of the most common Docker commands are built right into the Command Palette (`F1`):

### Docker View

The Docker extension contributes explorers to view and manage containers, images, registries, volumes, and networks. The right click context menus provide quick access to the same rich set of commands found in the Command Palette (`F1`).

**TIP**: You can reorder the explorers by clicking and dragging on the explorer title. You can also hide the entire view by right clicking on the Docker icon or hide individual explorers by right clicking on the explorer title.

#### Registries

The first time you expand the registries explorer you'll be prompted to connect a registry. This will prompt you for credentials based on your provider (Azure, Docker Hub, etc.). These credentials will be stored in your operating system credentials vault (for example macOS keychain, Windows Credential Store) so that you don't need to sign in every time. You can right click on a registry provider to disconnect it and remove credentials from the OS store.

> **NOTE**: Azure leverages the [Azure Account Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azure-account) instead of storing Docker-specific credentials. After connecting Azure, you will be prompted separately to install that extension and/or sign in.

### Deploy images to Azure App Service

With the Docker Explorer you can deploy images from Docker Hub Registries or Azure Container Registries directly to an Azure App Service instance. Check out [this tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/tutorials/docker-extension/getting-started) to get started.

### Azure CLI

Microsoft ships the latest [Azure CLI](https://github.com/azure/azure-cli) as a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/azuresdk/azure-cli-python/). You can easily launch a container running the CLI from the Command Palette (press F1 and search for `Docker Images: Run Azure CLI`). The extension will then run an interactive terminal attached to the container.

After the container is started, you will be prompted to sign in to your Azure account. From there, set the subscription you want to work with using `az account set` (you can see all of your subscriptions with `az account list`). You do not need to sign in every time you run the container because the extension volume mounts the local `$HOME/.azure` folder to the container's `$HOME/.azure` folder.

### Connect to `docker-machine`

The default behavior of the extension is to connect to the local Docker daemon. You can connect to a docker-machine instance if you launch Visual Studio Code and have the [Docker environment variables](https://docs.docker.com/machine/reference/env/) set in your environment or through the following VS Code settings: `docker.host`, `docker.certPath`, `docker.tlsVerify`, and `docker.machineName`.
