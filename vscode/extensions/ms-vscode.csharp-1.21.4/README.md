Welcome to the C# extension for Visual Studio Code! This extension provides the following features inside VS Code:

* Lightweight development tools for [.NET Core](https://dotnet.github.io).
* Great C# editing support, including Syntax Highlighting, IntelliSense, Go to Definition, Find All References, etc.
* Debugging support for .NET Core (CoreCLR). NOTE: Mono debugging is not supported. Desktop CLR debugging has [limited support](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/wiki/Desktop-.NET-Framework).
* Support for project.json and csproj projects on Windows, macOS and Linux.

The C# extension is powered by [OmniSharp](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn).

* Modified the auto generated tasks in tasks.json to generate full paths and disable summary to fix the problem of no source links in the problems panel.
* Improved analyzers performance by introducing background analysis support 
* End of support for .NET Core 1.0 and 1.1 (`project.json`-based .NET Core flavors).

    * macOS 10.12 (Sierra) and newer
    * Linux: see [.NET Core documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.2/2.2-supported-os.md#linux) for the list of supported distributions. Note that other Linux distributions will likely work as well as long as they include glibc and OpenSSL.
